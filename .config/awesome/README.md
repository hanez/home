awesome
=======

This directory contains my configuration for the "awesome" window manager. I do
all of my custom stuff here.

This theme requires the 'Adwaita' (https://github.com/GNOME/adwaita-icon-theme)
icon theme and the 'hicolor' (http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/icon-theme/)
icon theme installed on your system. Most OS distributions are providing 
packages. You are free to use the icon theme of your choice but you need to
configure this in "themes/hanez/theme.lua". The dependency to hicolor is not
configurable!
