~/bin
=====

This repository contains my ~/bin directory to make it easy to share it across
multiple hosts.

Scripts use a "+" as prefix to prevent name collisions in command completion.

Some scripts require a ~/.config.sh file where some config vars are defined.

No documentation! Maybe some day...
